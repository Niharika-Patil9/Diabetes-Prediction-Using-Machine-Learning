# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial in managing the condition and
preventing complications. This predictive model leverages historical data on patients' medical records, lifestyle factors, and other relevant information to make 
accurate predictions about the likelihood of diabetes development.
Diabetes Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various health-related features. 
It is built to aid healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of diabetes and take preventive measures early on.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to explore the application of machine learning techniques for predicting the risk of diabetes in individuals using the 
Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. Our primary research question asks: What lifestyle and health-related factors are associated with the likelihood of developing 
type 2 diabetes in female Native American Pima Indians aged 21 and above? The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset dataset contains various clinical and demographic variables 
of Pima Indian women, including information on their medical history, family history, and lifestyle. By analyzing this dataset and building predictive models using
machine learning algorithms, we aim to develop a model that can accurately predict the risk of diabetes in individuals, allowing for early diagnosis and intervention.

## Dataset
The dataset is called “The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset” and the source of the data (where it can be found/downloaded) is from Kaggle, though the dataset is originally 
found in the Machine Learning Repository from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease. 

## Methods 
Using R and R studio did Data Imputation, Variables Selection, Final model selection among the classigying models and interpretation. 

## Results
In terms of the findings from the models and their results, we found that the Decision Trees model was the most accurate compared to the Multiple Logistic Regression 
and Random Forests models.
